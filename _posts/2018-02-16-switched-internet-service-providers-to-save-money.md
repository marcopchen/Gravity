A huge part of reaching financial independence is reducing your expenses. The reasoning is twofold. You have more money to grow into even more money, and you find that you don't need as much to live. I covered most of my expenses from 2017 [here](http://marcopchen.com/2017/12/31/2017-financial-summary-part-2.html), and I wrote [here](http://marcopchen.com/2017/12/30/why-you-should-max-out-your-401k.html) on how important saving to invest is. Recurring expenses are the easiest way to deplete your piggy bank without you realizing it. I really recommend looking at your monthly bank account or credit card activity to see what charges have been sneaking up on you. Is there a gym membership or movie streaming subscription you have been neglecting? Cut it. if not, find a way to reduce the cost.
