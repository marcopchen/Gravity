A huge part of reaching financial independence is reducing your expenses. The reasoning is twofold. You have more money to grow into even more money, and you find that you don't need as much to live. I covered most of my expenses from 2017 [here](http://marcopchen.com/2017/12/31/2017-financial-summary-part-2.html), and I wrote [here](http://marcopchen.com/2017/12/30/why-you-should-max-out-your-401k.html) on how important saving to invest is.

Recurring expenses are the easiest way to deplete your piggy bank without you realizing it. I really recommend looking at your monthly bank account or credit card activity to see what charges have been sneaking up on you. Is there a gym membership or movie streaming subscription you haven't really been using? Cut it. If not, find a way to reduce the cost. For example, I split Spotify Premium with friends to pay only $2.50 every month. You can do the same with most subscription services like Netflix or Amazon Prime.

One of my bigger recurring expenses has been Internet, which is almost a basic necessity these days. We have had service from Optimum in our home since April 2016 when we moved in. Like all Internet service providers do, Optimum gives the first year at a discount. The bill was a reasonable $44.95 per month for a download speed of 50 Mbps. They also threw in the rental for a router and a modem for free. The monthly rate was increased to $64.90 in April 2017, and the download speed was changed to 60 Mbps. I believe they stopped offering 50 Mbps at some point before then. In July 2017, Optimum started charging a modem rental fee of $5 and changed our plan to 100 Mbps with a monthly rate of $70.29. This is when they made the cheapest options for speed to be 20 Mbps and 100 Mbps. Finally, they increased our download speed to 200 Mbps and monthly rate to $75.29 in November 2017. At this point, I was fed up with all the increases in price without notification and discussion. I decided to look into other options.

Thankfully, Verizon Fios was installed at our building in the past year. By the way, all my advice in this post probably doesn't apply if you don't have more than one option for Internet service where you live. I know that's an unfortunate reality for many Americans, but there's no leverage with a single provider to do much about the bill.
