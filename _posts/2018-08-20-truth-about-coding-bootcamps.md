Okay, so I'm going to try to answer one question here. Are coding bootcamps worth it?

You probably already know that a bootcamp program costs thousands and thousands of dollars. The one I did was part-time and cost $15,680. The full-time program at the same school costs $17,610. Those numbers are on par with what you can expect to attend a bootcamp program. That's a lot of money.

I finished my program toward the end of June 2018, and the one thing you're probably wondering about the most is how the job search went. Well, I got a job! It was after around 1.5 months from graduating. First of all, this is really fast. Most people don't get jobs that soon. You can check out CIRR for data on how bootcamp graduates fare in getting employed.

For me, doing the bootcamp was an investment that absolutely did pay off. I got my start in tech because of it, and the earning potential of my working career has now skyrocketed. However, I want to say that this may not be the case for everyone.

You probably have seen advertisements about learning how to code in 3 months and making 6 figures afterward. That is totally unrealistic, and I hate that bootcamps use this kind of marketing. I see plenty of bootcamp grads taking 3-6 months to land a job, and they’re almost never at the big companies like Google. Please keep realistic expectations and think twice before dropping everything for a bootcamp.

Let me stress again that bootcamps do not guarantee a job. This isn’t to say that you won’t learn a lot from attending one. You will most likely come out knowing how to build some really cool stuff, but that may not be enough to land a job. The fact of the matter is that the market is quite saturated. There are so many of these bootcamps nowadays, and they’re churning out fresh grads just about every month. You’ll still be competing against graduates from traditional CS college programs.

With all this saturation though, there always will be demand for software engineers. Save for the case of an apocalypse, tech is not going away. Just about every company needs some kind of software these days, and there are opportunities worldwide. How do you take advantage of one of those opportunities then? Like college, you can't expect to walk away from a bootcamp with a job in hand. You have to work for it.

Knowing how to code and knowing how to get a job are two very distinct skill sets. I’d like to think that I’m just decent enough with either, but I’m not particularly great either. I always hear from fellow bootcamp grads that everything that comes after the bootcamp program is harder than the actual bootcamp itself, and I can definitely see why that is. Stuff like resume writing, researching, networking, interviewing, etc. doesn’t come naturally. Thankfully, I already had quite a bit of experience with all that in my life pre-bootcamp. I think a lot of bootcamp grads don’t, and this holds them back a lot in their job search. Just like with coding, it takes time and practice to get better.
