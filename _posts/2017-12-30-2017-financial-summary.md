Here are some updates from my life in 2017.

Let me first discuss expenses. To be honest, I don't track them closely like most FI bloggers do. I just try to live as frugally as I can without jeopardizing my happiness. Thankfully, I'm happy with not much.

My big recurring expense is the maintenence and utilities for where I live. That costs me $850 every month, but it was about $900 for the past few months and will be until next June. My dad and I own the place outright, so there's no mortgage or rent. If you want to own property in NYC, the Bronx is cheap. My commute is long though. Subway fare is actually another recurring expense, but it's taken pre-tax from my paycheck. When you account for taxes, I end up paying less than the normal $121 for 30 day unlimited.

I still eat out for lunch unfortunately, and that probably costs me around $40 on average for my work week. I don't eat out much besides that. On the rare occasion I do go out with friends, I tend to have only 1 drink on the night. Bars are expensive! I keep large purchases to a minimum, and I always try to find the best price possible.

I think the steal of the year was probably the MacBook Air with AppleCare+ that I'm currently writing this post with. I got it on eBay for $680 and picked it up locally to save on shipping. The previous owner included the receipt, so I saw that I got this computer used for around 9 months at literally half of what she paid.

The biggest splurge was also Apple related. I paid a little over $800 for an iPhone 7 Plus with AppleCare+. Don't worry. I'm hoping to use this phone for a very long time. That's why I went with the max storage capacity of 256 GB. Unfortunately, I had to pay around $100 for a replacement phone from Apple after water damage in Mexico.

I wasted a lot of money by losing contact lenses this year. I have special ones and stockpiled a few pairs over the years. Each pair costs over $500. I haven't had to get a new pair for a few years, but I got one this past August and proceeded to lose a lens later. I'm down to my last mismatching pair. Thankfully, my vision in each eye is about equally as bad.

However, the biggest waste was the $3,677 that I lost in daily fantasy sports this year. Even with that, I'm still up about $2.5k over the two years that I played. I decided to finally retire this year after a few devastating losses. It was fun while it lasted.

I lost over $1k this year after buying 12 pairs of a certain shoe and selling them at a loss. Although, I also resold 5 pairs of an Adidas Yeezy shoe and made $860 profit off each. I've sold many other shoes this year, but none made profit close to those particular Yeezys. I'll continue to resell from time to time, mostly because it makes reaching minimum spend for credit cards so much easier.

I took a few vacations this year and definitely spent quite a bit of money there, but I also saved a lot through rewards from credit cards. I didn't pay for a single flight this year, and I also helped my parents with flights too! Check out the credit cards in my resources page. I used those to get where I am, and I plan on continung to get more. I don't want to pay for a flight ever again.

Most people don't have access to a 457(b), but I do with my current employer. 401(k) and 457(b) have the same dollar limit to contributions, and they don't overlap. You can contribute to each up to $18k. By the way, 2017 is actually my first year contributing to one of these or an IRA.

I began the year by contributing to my 457(b) with 75% of my paycheck and maxed it out in the summer. I started contributing the same percentage to my 401(k) afterward and put in around $3k, but I had to start saving for my tuition to [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/). I'll start contributing to my 457(b) again when 2018 starts and hope to max out within 6 months with 75% of my paycheck again. I did it this year, and it should be faster in 2018 due to a raise this past June. 401(k) and 457(b) pre-tax contribution limits for 2018 will be $500 higher than for 2017.

I also maxed out my Roth IRA earlier in the year for the year of 2016, and I'm planning to max out my Roth IRA for 2017 by April 2018. Remember that you have until Tax Day of the following year to contribute for any given year.

I donâ€™t have a plan set for 401(k) next year, but I will contribute something. Also, a small percentage of my paycheck goes to a 414(h) earning 5% compounded interest.
