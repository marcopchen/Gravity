Here are some updates from my life in 2017.

This first part will be about my investments. Most of my money is in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. that includes [Roth IRA](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Roth_ira), [traditional 401(k)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/401(k)), [457(b)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/457(b)), and [414(h)](https://www.reference.com/business-finance/414h-retirement-plan-2587fc5efe85600e).

I'll start with the 414(h), since most people probably never heard of it. It's called a pension plan where I work, and it's only for government employees. For me specifically, it's pretty much a glorified savings account earning 5% [compounded interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest) that I can contribute pre-tax. I wrote [here](https://marcopchen.github.io/2017/12/30/why-you-should-max-out-your-401k.html) why pre-tax is important. 5% return on investment is amazing for no risk. I hope for higher with my other retirement accounts, but those are dependent on the market and carry risk. The current percentage of my paycheck going to my 414(h) is 3.5%, and it'll be 4.5% in 2018. I believe it was 3% when I started in September 2016. I don't choose the percentage. It's based off my salary.

Most people don't have access to a 457(b), but I do as a government employee. 401(k) and 457(b) have the same dollar limit to contributions, and they don't overlap. You can contribute to each up to the limit separately. A 457(b) is basically a 401(k), but you can withdraw from it without penalty before age 59.5. This is a ridiculously good perk. If you have access to one, I implore you to contribute. You don't have much to lose. I still plan to withdraw from 401(k) before 59.5 years old, but most people probably don't want to deal with that hassle. By the way, 2017 is actually my first year contributing to one of these or an IRA. I just turned 24 this month, so it's never too early to start!

Now you know why I focus on maxing out my 457(b) first, which I did this summer by contributing since January with 75% of my paycheck. I started contributing the same percentage to my 401(k) afterward and put in around $3k, but I had to start saving for my tuition to [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/). I'll start contributing to my 457(b) again with 75% when 2018 starts and hope to max out within 6 months. I did it this year, and it should a bit be faster in 2018 due to a raise this past June. 401(k) and 457(b) pre-tax contribution limits for 2018 have increased by $500 each.

I donâ€™t have a plan set for 401(k) next year, but I will definitely contribute. My hope is to find another job very soon after graduating from my bootcamp program, and I can just use the 401(k) with whoever the new employer. With a higher salary, I'd max it out faster anyway. I'm also hoping for employer matching, which most companies have. I don't currently get any employer contributions. It might get messy contributing to two different 401(k) plans in the same year, but I might just have to if I don't find another job early enough.

I also maxed out my Roth IRA this past March for the year of 2016, and I'm planning to max out my Roth IRA for 2017 by April 2018. Remember that you have until Tax Day of the following year to contribute for any given year. Since my current salary isn't the greatest, I kind of just hold onto my would-be contribution money as emergency funds until Tax Day.

Last thing to talk about is my investment portfolio. Unlike most people in the FI community, I don't have a strict [asset allocation](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset_allocation) or any funds with [Vanguard](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group). My Roth IRA is actually with [Charles Schwab](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Charles_Schwab) and comprises their funds, which seem to have the lowest fees in the game. My 401(k) and 457(b) are through the New York City Deferred Compensation Plan. The actual funds are managed by various investment firms. My investment asset allocation is currently 100% stocks with 80% being United States and 20% being international. I don't carry bond funds in my portfolio due to my young age and high risk tolerance.

In my 401(k)/457(b), I don't have a fund option that tracks the total U.S. stock market. It's a good thing there's not much difference between the return from tracking the total stock market and tracking the S&P 500, which I do have a fund option for. After reading The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins, I transferred everything from a [target date fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_date_fund) that I contributed to earlier in the year. A target date fund may be totally hands-off, but it typically comes with higher fees. It's made up of several different funds, and I realized that I really only needed one.

I did recently just add a fund that tracks the S&P 400 as well to get some diversity in my 401(k)/457(b). Using low-cost funds that track mid-cap indexes like the S&P 400 and small-cap indexes like the Russell 2000 can help approximate the total U.S. stock market index. Check [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_stock_market) on how to do so. I personally do 80% for the fund tracking S&P 500 and 20% for the fund tracking S&P 400, because the S&P 500 makes up around 80% of the total U.S. stock market in capitalization. I do have a fund option tracking the Russell 2000 as well and would have used that, but this particular one has a really high [expense ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expense_ratio). I think I should be okay though.

I also have a fund option for international stocks in my 401(k)/457(b), but that also has a high expense ratio. Expense ratio is what I mean by fund fees, and minimizing fees is vital for maximizing returns. You can't predict future returns, but your current fees are known. To get exposure to the international stock market, I use a single fund from Charles Schwab in my Roth IRA. This particular fund SWISX doesn't have exposure to the Canadian market, emerging markets, and most of the international small-cap market. This is sort of like the difference between tracking the total U.S. stock market and tracking the S&P 500. Again, I think I'll be fine.

I will most likely keep this asset allocation for the foreseeable future. I have to manually buy and sell funds to adjust my Roth IRA, so I'm just going to keep everything there in one fund. It works out to a percentage of my overall portfolio that I'm comfortable with anyway. Of course, my allocation will change depending on returns and additional contributions. When I switch jobs, I'll also have a different 401(k) plan with different fund options. I'll cross that bridge when the time comes.

Sorry for the long post. It's my first year with this stuff, and I want to document it thoroughly. There's still a second part to my financial summary to talk about everything outside of investments!
