title: A Brutally Honest Review of Fullstack Academy

I wanted to write this post after a good amount of time and reflection. Mainly though, I wanted to see how the job search panned out for everyone. It's now been close to 4 months since I finished the immersive software engineering program at [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/), and I want to discuss my experience. I want to make clear first that I attended the part-time program, and I was at the original campus in NYC. There is a Chicago campus as well.

I've written [here](http://www.marcopchen.com/2017/12/29/changing-careers-and-coding-bootcamps.html) about my decision to enter Fullstack Academy and talked through my thought process of choosing this bootcamp over others. That post came at the end of 2017 right before I started the program. I recently discussed [here](http://www.marcopchen.com/2018/08/20/truth-about-coding-bootcamps.html) on whether coding bootcamps are worth doing, but I didn't really talk specifically about Fullstack Academy.

I don't want to go in depth on the actual experience of attending Fullstack Academy, since there are so many reviews on [Course Report](https://www.coursereport.com/) and [SwitchUp](https://www.switchup.org/) with lots to read on that. By the way, I want to point out something about these reviews. From what I can tell, almost all the reviews are from grads who have already secured a job after finishing the program or fresh grads who haven't really been through the job search yet. That means the reviews does skew positively. With looking at reviews for anything, you have to consider who is doing the reviewing. For Fullstack Academy, I was only contacted to leave a review of the school on these sites after giving notification of accepting a job offer. Everyone wants to look good, so I completely understand why they do this. Just be mindful of it when reading reviews.

From a purely educational standpoint, Fullstack Academy is great. I think it deserves the acclaim that it gets for that regard. When I meet grads from other schools, I feel like grads from Fullstack Academy somehow learned more. I don't know how, since I feel like curricula between all these bootcamp programs are pretty much the same. When I look at the projects that come out of Fullstack Academy, I'm always super impressed. The projects are on their YouTube channel and website, so feel free to check them out. What I believe is the best thing that Fullstack Academy teaches is how to work in a group. In the second half of the program, students are given one major project and the final project both done as groups. I know that other bootcamp programs have their final projects done individually. Working on a group project is the closest simulation that you can get to working professionally. You'll have to deal with version control and different personalities.

I want to speak on my experience specifically with the part-time program, because there aren't many reviews for it. Due to the nature of a part-time program, it brings a different type of students. My cohort had around 20 students, and around half of them weren't looking to make the career switch to become developers. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it can dampen the experience of those are completely focused on becoming developers. For example, I was the only person out of my group of 4 for the final project who was going for the career switch. Naturally, I'd be more motivated to work on the project and impress prospective employers. If anyone cares about this, part-time students also tend to be older. I was the youngest one in my cohort, and I found myself hanging out with full-time students outside of class. They were closer to my age and came in during the weekends like I did.

Unfortunately, the part-time program always felt like an afterthought. The other students in my cohort and I sometimes felt that we weren't treated on the same level as the full-time students. At times, it felt like the career services team forgot about us. The positives about the part-time program include having more time to absorb knowlege. Our instructor Eric Katz had years of industry experience and tried to structure the curriculum to prioritize what he felt was important in the real world. On top of our regular assignments, he also gave us little projects to do on weekends. I always felt like he cared about us, which I really appreciated.

Here's where my gripes come in. I don't think Fullstack Academy helps their grads much in landing jobs. First, I just want to state that there really is only so much an outside party can help one in this journey. Ultimately, nobody can interview for you. Nobody can write your resume for you. Nobody can network as you. However, I think there's an issue when so many grads are unable to find jobs. By the way, most of this criticism can probably be said about other bootcamps. I can only speak on what I see from Fullstack Academy. Out of the 10 or so people from my cohort who have gone onto job search, 4 have secured jobs after almost 4 months after graduation. It seems that the full-stime students who graduated around the same time haven't had much more luck.

The lack of jobs isn't at the fault of Fullstack Academy, because there's a clear saturation in the job market with all these bootcamp grads flooding it. It's now been over 5 years since the first bootcamps started popping up, and the market isn't the same anymore. In the earlier years, bootcamp grads came in and filled a need in the tech industry. Now that the need has been met for the most part, it's harder for people to just jump into a job after acquiring some knowlege. You can see this in the data from outcomes reports out of bootcamps. Employment after graduation rate and average salary seems to trend downward over the years.
