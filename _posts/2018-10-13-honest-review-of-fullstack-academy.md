title: A Brutally Honest Review of Fullstack Academy

I wanted to write this post after a good amount of time and reflection. It's now been close to 4 months since I finished the immersive software engineering program at Fullstack Academy, and I want to discuss my experience. I want to put a disclaimer up front that I attended the part-time program, and I was at the original campus in NYC. There is a Chicago campus as well.

I've written [here](http://www.marcopchen.com/2017/12/29/changing-careers-and-coding-bootcamps.html) about my decision to enter Fullstack Academy and talked through my thought process of choosing this bootcamp over others. That post came at the end of 2017 right before I started the program. I recently discussed [here](http://www.marcopchen.com/2018/08/20/truth-about-coding-bootcamps.html) on whether coding bootcamps are worth doing, but I didn't really talk specifically about Fullstack Academy. Keep in mind that I was coming more from the perspective of landing a job making a bootcamp to be worth it or not, as opposed to how much one could learn from a bootcamp.
