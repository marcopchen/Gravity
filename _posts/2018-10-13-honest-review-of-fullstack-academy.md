title: A Brutally Honest Review of Fullstack Academy

I wanted to write this post after a good amount of time and reflection. It's now been close to 4 months since I finished the immersive software engineering program at Fullstack Academy, and I want to discuss my experience. I want to put a disclaimer up front that I attended the part-time program, and I was at the original campus in NYC. There is a Chicago campus as well.

I've written [here](http://www.marcopchen.com/2017/12/29/changing-careers-and-coding-bootcamps.html) about my decision to enter Fullstack Academy and talked through my thought process of choosing this bootcamp over others. That post came at the end of 2017 right before I started the program. I recently discussed [here](http://www.marcopchen.com/2018/08/20/truth-about-coding-bootcamps.html) on whether coding bootcamps are worth doing, but I didn't really talk specifically about Fullstack Academy. Keep in mind that I was coming more from the perspective of landing a job making a bootcamp to be worth it or not, as opposed to how much one could learn from a bootcamp.

I don't want to go in depth on the actual experience of attending Fullstack Academy, because there are so many reviews on [Course Report](https://www.coursereport.com/) and [SwitchUp](https://www.switchup.org/) with lots to read about that. By the way, I want to point out something about these reviews. From what I can tell, almost all the reviews are from grads who have already secured a job after finishing the program or fresh grads who haven't really been through the job search yet. That means the reviews will skew positively, because the reviews aren't coming from a place of despair. With looking at reviews for anything, you have to consider who is doing the reviewing. For Fullstack Academy, I was only contacted to leave a review of the school on these sites after giving notification of accepting a job offer. Everyone wants to look good, so I completely understand why they do this. Just be mindful of it when reading reviews.

From a purely educational standpoint, Fullstack Academy is great. I think it deserves the acclaim that it gets for that regard. When I meet grads from other schools, I feel like grads from Fullstack Academy somehow learned more. I don't know how, since I feel like curricula between all these bootcamp programs are pretty much the same. When I look at the projects that come out of Fullstack Academy, I'm always super impressed. The projects are on their YouTube channel and website, so feel free to check them out. The best thing that I believe Fullstack Academy teaches is how to work in a group. In the second half of the program, students are given one major project and a final project both done as groups. I know that other bootcamp programs have their final projects done individually. Working on a group project is the closest simulation that you can get to working professionally. You'll have to deal with version control and different personalities.

I'll just speak really quickly about my experience specifically with the part-time program, because there aren't many reviews for that. Due to the nature of a part-time program, it brings a different type of students. My cohort had around 20 students, and around half of them weren't looking to make the career switch to become developers. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it can dampen the experience of those are completely focused on becoming developers. For example, I was the only one out of my group of 4 for our final project who was going for the career switch. Naturally, I'd be more motivated to work on the project and impress prospective employers. If anyone cares about this, part-time students also tend to be older. I was the youngest one in my cohort, and I found myself hanging out with full-time students outside of class. They were closer to my age and came in during the weekends like I did.
