Here are some updates from my life in 2017.

Let me first discuss my investments. Most of my money is in tax advantaged retirement accounts. that includes [Roth IRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roth_IRA), traditional [401(k)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401(k)), [457(b)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/457_plan), and 414(h).

I'll start with the 414(h), since most people probably never heard of it. It's called a pension plan where I work, and it's only for government employees. For me specifically, it's pretty much a glorified savings account earning 5% compounded interest that I can contribute pre-tax. 5% is amazing for no risk. I hope for a lot more in return with my other retirement accounts, but those are dependent on the market and carry risk. The current purcentage of my paycheck going to my 414(h) is 3.5%, and it'll be 4.5% in 2018. I believe it was 3% when I started in September 2016. I don't choose the percentage. It's based off my income.

Most people don't have access to a 457(b), but I do with my current employer. 401(k) and 457(b) have the same dollar limit to contributions, and they don't overlap. You can contribute to each up to $18k. By the way, 2017 is actually my first year contributing to one of these or an IRA.

I began the year by contributing to my 457(b) with 75% of my paycheck and maxed it out in the summer. I started contributing the same percentage to my 401(k) afterward and put in around $3k, but I had to start saving for my tuition to [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/). I'll start contributing to my 457(b) again when 2018 starts and hope to max out within 6 months with 75% of my paycheck again. I did it this year, and it should be faster in 2018 due to a raise this past June. 401(k) and 457(b) pre-tax contribution limits for 2018 will be $500 higher than for 2017.

I also maxed out my Roth IRA earlier in the year for the year of 2016, and I'm planning to max out my Roth IRA for 2017 by April 2018. Remember that you have until Tax Day of the following year to contribute for any given year.

I donâ€™t have a plan set for 401(k) next year, but I will contribute something. 

There's not too much difference between the return on tracking the total stock market like VTSAX does and the return on tracking the S&P 500 like VFIAX does. If you don't have access to a fund like VTSAX, VTFIAX is still a fantastic option. In my 401(k) and 457(b), I don't have a fund option that tracks the total stock market. After reading The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins, I transferred everything from a target date retirement fund to a fund that tracks the S&P 500. I recently just added a fund that tracks the S&P 400 as well to get some diversity. See if you have any low-cost index fund options that track mid-cap indexes like the S&P 400 and small-cap indexes like the Russell 2000. If you do, then you can approximate the total stock market index. I personally did 80% for the fund tracking S&P 500 and 20% for the fund tracking S&P 400. I do have a fund option tracking the Russell 2000 and would have used that, but this particular one has a really high expense ratio. I think I should be okay though.
