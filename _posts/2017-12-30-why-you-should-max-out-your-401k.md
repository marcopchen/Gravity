Most people only contribute just enough to their [401(k)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/401(k)) to get matched by their employer, but I would always max it out or at least put in as much as I can afford. I don't even get employer contributions at my current job, and I still would max out.

I'm talking about traditional 401(k), which is what almost everyone with a 401(k) uses anyway. The traditional part means that contributions are made pre-tax. My advice also applies to other retirement accounts.

Pre-tax means taken out of one's paycheck before taxes are taken from the money. Contributing pre-tax to retirement accounts lets you avoid paying taxes on that money now, but you pay taxes later when the money is withdrawn. This means more money now to invest with and to grow until you retire. Depending on your income level, you can even lower your tax rate by making pre-tax contributions. For example, I'm supposed to be at the 25% tax bracket for 2017. Since I put away so much money pre-tax, I should be in the 15% tax bracket instead. That's a 10% difference! When I finally do retire, I plan to be in a tax bracket with a tax rate no more than 15%. That means the pre-tax money I'm putting away now won't be taxed as much in the future as it would be if I had to pay taxes on it now without lowering my taxable income. Basically, I save a lot on taxes through pre-tax contributions. Besides those with very low income in their working years, people generally don't need as much income during retirement. Like I plan to be, most should be in a lower tax bracket than when they were working. Granted, I don't know what the tax brackets will look like in the future when I do retire and have to pay taxes. In fact, they've already changed for 2018. What I know for sure is that I can get more money now to invest, so I'll have more money in the future due to compounded returns. Any tax savings would be nice too.

Personally, I contribute pre-tax to 401(k), 457(b), and 414(h). I go Roth for my IRA though, and that means I contribute with post-tax income. One of my favorite bloggers Mad Fientist makes a great argument [here](https://www.madfientist.com/traditional-ira-vs-roth-ira/) for going traditional with IRA, but I have my reasons for otherwise. First, my tax rate is so low currently that I probably wouldn't be saving much on post-retirement taxes by contributing pre-tax now. However, I'll most likely contribute to a traditional IRA instead of Roth as soon as my income and tax rate increase. Second, I just like to have some tax diversification, since I don't know how tax laws might change in the future. With a Roth IRA, I don't have to worry about taxes on that money ever. Most of my contributions to retirement accounts is still pre-tax anyway, since the limit for IRA is much lower than for 401(k) and 457(b). I also like the ability to withdraw my contributions from a Roth IRA without penalty at any time. 401(k) and traditional IRA need one to be age 59.5 to withdraw money (contributed or earned) without penalty, but there are ways around that discussed [here](https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/). If I do a Roth ladder conversion, I still have to wait 5 years before getting money from a 401(k). Withdrawing contribution money from Roth IRA can be a form of income during that time. This is just how I do things, but feel free to go traditional with IRA. Your tax bracket is probably the biggest factor in that decision. By the way, there are other accounts like 403(b) and HSA that you may have access to and can contribute to.

Folks, please contribute to your 401(k). Don't think it's too early to be thinking about retirement. Even if you don't plan on retiring early like I do, you're still getting a lot of tax benefits from contributing. Also, contributing earlier gives you more value than contributing later. This applies to saving and investing with any kind of account. That is the power of compounding. For example, $10k invested now will be worth more than $10k invested 20 years from now. That means the more you put away now, the exponentially less you'll have to put away later. Keep in mind that all retirement accounts have contribution limits, so you may not be able to contribute as much as you'd like if you decide later in life to go heavy on contributing. You can always cut back on contributions, but you'll never be able to make up lost value from contributing earlier. Don't wait until you're eating cat food at retirement.
