title: Why You Should Max Out Your 401(k)

Most people only contribute just enough to their [401(k)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/401(k)) to get matched by their employer, but I would always max it out or at least put in as much as I can afford. I don't even get employer contributions at my current job, and I still would max out.

I'm talking about traditional 401(k), which is what almost everyone with a 401(k) uses anyway. The traditional part means that contributions are made pre-tax. My advice also applies to other retirement accounts. I'll just refer to 401(k) in this post, since that's the most popular.

Pre-tax means taken out of one's paycheck before taxes are taken. Contributing pre-tax to retirement accounts lets you avoid paying taxes on that money now, but you pay taxes later when the money is withdrawn. This means more money now to invest with and to grow until you retire. Depending on your income level, you can even lower your tax bracket by making pre-tax contributions. For example, I'm supposed to be at the 25% tax bracket for 2017. Since I put away so much money pre-tax, I should be in the 15% tax bracket instead. That's a 10% difference! When I finally do retire, I plan to be in a tax bracket with lower than 25% tax rate. Therefore, I'll still be saving in taxes in the future. Besides those with very low income in their working years, people generally don't need as much income during retirement. Granted, I don't know what the tax brackets will look like in the future when I do have to pay taxes. They've already changed for 2018. All I know is that I can get more money now to invest, so I'll have more money in the future due to compounded returns.

Personally, I contribute pre-tax to 401(k), 457(b), and 414(h). I go Roth for my IRA though, and that means I contribute with post-tax income. One of my favorite bloggers Mad Fientist makes a great argument [here](https://www.madfientist.com/traditional-ira-vs-roth-ira/) for going traditional with IRA, but I have my reasons for otherwise. First, I like to have some tax diversification. Yes, I'm most likely paying more in taxes now than when I retire. However, I'm not psychic and can't know what tax laws are going to be then. Most of my contributions to retirement accounts is still pre-tax anyway, since the limit for IRA is much lower than 401(k) and 457(b). I also like the ability to withdraw my contributions from a Roth IRA without penalty at any time. 401(k) and traditional IRA need one to be age 59.5 to withdraw money (contributed or earned) without penalty, but there are ways around that discussed [here](https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/). If I do a Roth ladder conversion, I still have to wait 5 years before getting money from a 401(k). Withdrawing contribution money from Roth IRA can be a form of income during that time. This is just how I do things, but feel free to go traditional with IRA. There are other accounts like 403(b) and HSA that you may have access to and can contribute to.

Folks, please contribute to your 401(k). Don't think it's too early to be thinking about retirement. Even if you don't plan on retiring early like I do, you're still getting a lot of tax benefits from contributing. You will lower your current taxable income! Also, contributing earlier gives you more value than contributing later. That is the power of compounding. This applies to saving and investing with any kind of account. For example, $10k invested now will be worth more than $10k invested 20 years from now. That means the more you put away now, the exponentially less you'll have to put away later. Keep in mind that all retirement accounts have contribution limits, so you may not be able to contribute as much as you'd like if you start later. You can always cut back on contributions, but you'll never be able to make up lost value from contributing earlier. Don't wait until you're eating cat food at retirement.
