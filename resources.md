  <h4>Book</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1533667926/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1533667926&linkCode=as2&tag=marcopchen-20&linkId=340fffe0b2ae0374d3a8c7e5d4a4495e">The Simple Path to Wealth</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=marcopchen-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1533667926" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

        <p>
          I think this is the book for beginners in financial independence. It breaks everything down very simply. I don't necessarily agree with JL Collins' approach to asset allocation, but the convenience can make sense for people who are new to investing.

        <p>
          This really covers everything on why you should be invested in index funds. You won't doubt the process after reading this. I know it definitely opened my eyes. Bogleheads also have a great wiki that I usually link to in my posts.

          This one is different than most FI content. It's published by Bigger Pockets, which is all about real estate investing. It's not really about REI, by the book pretty much recommends it as the way to get to financial independence over investing in the stock market.

          Most people say that owning a home is a good investment. This book will show you otherwise. In many real estate markets, you can actually create more wealth by renting.

  <h4>Blog/Podcast</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/">Doctor of Credit</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This is the site for everything on credit card and bank account bonuses. I always refer to Doctor of Credit to see details on how to get a bonus, and I also find out about new bonuses on there.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.madfientist.com/">Mad Fientist</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          Mad Fientist has some amazing posts on specific strategies one can use to get to financial independence. I listen to the podcast, but there haven't been many new episodes.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.choosefi.com/">ChooseFI</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          I would say that the ChooseFI podcast is better for beginners, because it does have a lot of episodes on fundamentals and different aspects of financial independence. It has also stemmed active groups on Facebook.

  <h4>Credit Card</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?SPID=FPZY&CELL=61T9&MSC=1540985827">Chase Sapphire Reserve</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This credit card has a sign-up bonus of 50,000 Ultimate Rewards points, and I consider it to be the greatest card out there for travel. You get $300 credit every year that can be used on anything related to travel and transportation, so that basically cuts the fee down from $450 to $150. You get perks such as airport lounge access and what I consider to be the best feature: 1.5x redemption multiplier for travel. This makes your points worth so much more, and you can even pool together points earned from other Chase cards to use. The bonus is worth $500 in cash or $750 in travel.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?SPID=FP3F&CELL=63HB&MSC=1540538308">Chase Ink Business Preferred</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This credit card currently has the highest sign-up bonus available from Chase. The bonus is 80,000 Ultimate Rewards points. That equals to $800 in cash or $1,000 in travel with the 1.25x redemption multiplier. If you have Chase Sapphire Reserve, the bonus is worth $1,200 in travel. The annual fee is $95 and not waived.
        </p>

    <li>
      <a href="https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?SPID=FNLC&CELL=63HB&MSC=1544821958">Chase Sapphire Preferred</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This credit card has a sign-up bonus of 50,000 Ultimate Rewards points, and you can get 5,000 more for adding an authorized user. This card also has the 1.25x redemption multiplier. The annual fee is $95 and waived for the first year.

    <li>
      <a href="https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?SPID=FNS7&CELL=63HB&MSC=1532530899">Chase Freedom</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This credit card has a sign-up bonus of 15,000 Ultimate Rewards points or $150. There is no annual fee.

    <li>
      <a href="https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?SPID=FNRV&CELL=63HB&MSC=1535221495">Chase Freedom Unlimited</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This credit card has a sign-up bonus of 15,000 Ultimate Rewards points or $150. There is no annual fee.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://refer.amex.us/MARCOCe6Ei?XLINK=MYCP">American Express Business Rewards Gold</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This credit card has a sign-up bonus of 50,000 Membership Rewards points. The annual fee is $175 and waived for the first year.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://refer.amex.us/MARCOCp1wn?xl=cp15">American Express Gold Delta SkyMiles Business</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This credit card has a sign-up bonus of 60,000 Delta SkyMiles miles and $50 statement credit. The annual fee is $95 and waived for the first year.

  <h4>Bank Account</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/refer-prospect.html">Charles Schwab Investor Checking</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          You get $100 from using this link to sign up. I don't get anything from this. I just want everyone to know how good the checking account from Schwab is. There are no monthly fees at all, and you get reimbursed for all ATM fees. This is perfect for international travel, because you never have to worry about exchanging money. Whenever I need cash even locally, I don't bother trying to find my bank. I just go to whichever ATM is closest. To open the checking account, you do have to open the brokerage account as well and get your credit report pulled.

  <h4>App/Site</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/marcoc2035">Airbnb</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          Get $40 off your first booking by signing up here! I've used Airbnb before to save money during travel, but do your research when booking. Hotels can be cheaper than Airbnb in certain locations. If you ever find yourself visiting the Poconos, you should book a stay at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15146241">my parent's place</a>! It's a lovely house and has received wonderful reviews.
        </p>

    <li>
      <a href="https://turo.com/c/marcoc309">Turo</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          I've used Turo before to rent a car in the NYC area, and it was pretty cheap. It's kind of like Airbnb, except with cars. Sign up here to get $25 off your first booking!

      <a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/n0kq1c">Honey</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          Honey has helped me save money by automatically searching for available discount codes in any checkout. You can add it to your browser with a simple click.

      <a href="https://share.robinhood.com/marcoc199">Robinhood</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          I actually don't recommend investing in individual stocks. If you know the risk and still want to, I guess you might as well go with Robinhood. You get a free share of stock if you sign up here.
