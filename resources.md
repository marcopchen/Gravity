    Below are books, articles, podcasts, products, services, apps, etc. that have helped me on my journey. Please feel free to contact me for help with anything or more info. Some links may benefit me, so I really appreciate using them if you are actually interested. Thank you for the support!

    <h4>Blogs/Podcasts</h4>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.choosefi.com/">ChooseFI</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          I would say that the ChooseFI podcast is better for beginners, because it does have a lot of episodes on fundamentals and different aspects of financial independence. The site has also stemmed active groups on Facebook.

      <br>
        <p>
          Mad Fientist has some amazing posts on specific strategies one can use to get to financial independence. I listen to the podcast, but there haven't been many new episodes.

    <h4>Credit Cards</h4>
    <li>
      <a href="https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?SPID=FPZY&CELL=61T9&MSC=1540985827">Chase Sapphire Reserve</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This credit card has a sign-up bonus of 50,000 Ultimate Rewards points. The card has a steep annual fee of $450, but I consider it to be the greatest card out there for travel. You get $300 credit every year that can be used on anything related to travel and transportation, so that basically cuts the fee down to $150. You get perks such as airport lounge access and what I consider to be the best feature: 1.5x redemption multiplier for travel. This makes your points worth so much more, and you can even pool together points earned from other Chase cards to use. The bonus is worth $500 in cash or $750 in travel.

      <a href="https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?SPID=FP3F&CELL=63HB&MSC=1540538308">Chase Ink Business Preferred</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This credit card currently has the highest sign-up bonus available from Chase. The bonus is 80,000 Ultimate Rewards points. That equals to $800 in cash or $1,000 in travel with the 1.25x redemption multiplier. If you have Chase Sapphire Reserve, the bonus is worth $1,200 in travel. The annual fee is $95 and not waived.

          This credit card has a sign-up bonus of 15,000 Ultimate Rewards points or $150. There is no annual fee.

      <a href="http://refer.amex.us/MARCOCp1wn?xl=cp15">Amex Gold Delta SkyMiles Business</a>
      <br>
        <p>

    <h4>Apps/Sites</h4>
    <li>
      <a href="https://share.robinhood.com/marcoc199">Robinhood</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          I actually don't recommend in investing in individual stocks. If you know the risk and still want to, I guess you might as well go with Robinhood. We both get a free share of stock if you sign up here.

      <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a1b2978d15cc9021e8aad20">Coinbase</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          Going into cryptocurrency is another risky venture, but we both get $10 worth of Bitcoin if you sign up here.
