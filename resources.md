      <h4>Chase Sapphire Reserve</h4>
        <p>

      <h4>Chase Ink Business Preferred</h4>
        <p>
          This credit card currently has the highest sign-up bonus from Chase, and I consider it to be best bonus out there overall. The bonus is 80,000 Ultimate Rewards points. That equals to $800 in cash or $1,000 in travel using this card or Chase Sapphire Preferred to redeem the points. If you have Chase Sapphire Reserve, the bonus is worth $1,200 in travel with the 1.5x redemption multiplier. The annual fee is $95 and not waived.
