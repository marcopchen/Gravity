    <h4>Credit Cards</h4>
    <li>
      <a href="https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?SPID=FPZY&CELL=61T9&MSC=1540985827">Chase Sapphire Reserve</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This credit card has a sign-up bonus of 50,000 Ultimate Rewards points. I consider it to be the best out there for travel. It has a steep annual fee of $450 that's not waived, but I believe the card is well worth it. You get $300 credit every year that can be used on anything related to travel and transportation, so that basically cuts the fee down to $150. You get perks such as airport lounge access and what I consider to be the best feature: 1.5x redemption multiplier for travel. This makes your points worth so much more, and you can even pool together points earned from other Chase cards as well.

      <a href="https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?SPID=FP3F&CELL=63HB&MSC=1540538308">Chase Ink Business Preferred</a>
      <br>
        <p>
          This credit card currently has the highest sign-up bonus from Chase, and I consider it to be best bonus out there overall. The bonus is 80,000 Ultimate Rewards points. That equals to $800 in cash or $1,000 in travel using this card or Chase Sapphire Preferred  with the 1.25x redemption multiplier. If you have Chase Sapphire Reserve, the bonus is worth $1,200 in travel. The annual fee is $95 and not waived.
