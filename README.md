    Hi, my name is Marco. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Welcome to my website. There's not much on here, but I'll continue to add onto it. Feel free to read my blog posts and check out the resources that have helped me. Enjoy!
    <br>
    <br>
    This site will mostly be about personal finance, and it'll document my path to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/faq">financial independence</a>. I'll talk about the steps I'm taking and my plans going forward. My hope is to help people work towards their freedom. That's what financial indepedence is really about, and I think it's a worthy goal for anyone.
    <br>
    <br>
    I will most likely be discussing other topics on this site such as programming and traveling. Everything in my life is fair game for this site, and I hope you find it at least somewhat interesting. I'd like to think that I think very outside of the box, and I wanted to start blogging to express those thoughts. I also just want to share my adventures!
